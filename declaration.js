/* we can declare variables in three ways
1:var =scope of variable is functional,it can be updated and re-declared into the scope.

2:let =scope of variable is block scope ,it can be updated but and cannot be re-declared into the scope.


3:constant =scope of variable is block scope , it cannot be updated and cannot be re-declared into the scope.
           it cannot be declared without initialization.

           Globale:
           variables declared globally , (outside any function) have global scope.
           globale variables can be accessed from anywhere in javascript programme.
           variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block
